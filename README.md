# Seafloor_mapping_PointNet2
A seafloor mapping model based on PointNet++ using Pytorch

### Usage
#### Model training
Firstly, make sure you have at least one ICESat-2 h5 file in you data directory, then change mode to 'train', and run:
```commandline
preprocessing_script.sh
```

Then, annotate the data in the 'split_data' folder. Remember to put your annotated data in a folder called 'input_data'.

Lastly, when your data is ready, run:
```commandline
train_script.sh
test_script.sh
```

#### Model prediction
Make sure you have at least one ICESat-2 h5 file in you data directory, then change mode to 'test', and run:
```commandline
preprocessing_script.sh
predict_script.sh
```

#### Data
We have provided the training data in "data_8192.zip".

And we've also provided the trained model "model.pth" in the "trained_model" folder.
